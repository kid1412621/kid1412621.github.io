# Windows 11 dev setup

Windows as an OS companied me over 2 decades (started from win 95) reluctantly or willingly, since it was phenomenonally popular pirated software in China. After I encountered other OSs as a developer, I still get a special feeling about Windows even lots of poeple complaining about its bloat and privacy. To be frank, the dev experience did fade next to Unix systems. However Microsoft devotes to improve this, Windows 11 got much better experience in different ways (yes, it still sucks in certain way). And I do enjoy the variety of OS for nerds like me, so Windows is still part of my daily developing and gaming activities.

## Terminal

## Powershell

## VSCode

## WSL

### WSL 2

### WSLg

## Package Manager

### Winget
Linux got `apt`/`apt-get`, `dnf`/`yum`, `pacman` etc. MacOS got `brew`. So why Windows doesn't? As Windows official package manager, `winget` is still relative naive and the repo lists are not abundant. But basic usages are satisfied.

Not recommend to use `winget` to install apps from Microsoft Store since this may conflict with x86/64 app (e.g. the powershell from msstore is different than the counterpart one). Besides, some apps are missing, like Netflix. If you try to use `winget search` to find such app, the result will be different than using search bar in msstore.
